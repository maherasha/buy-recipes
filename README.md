# buy-recipes

**The problem**
 The feature is called “Buy Recipes”. Currently our e-commerce platform only allows users to
buy simple products, the idea is to allow them to buy an entire recipe (every ingredient
of a recipe is a product we already have).

Keep in mind that our system already has a cart functionality and we’ll be extending it to
support recipes, in addition to products (the product functionality does not need to be
implemented)

**Terminology**
Recipe: A recipe has at least a non-empty set of products and a name, you should consider further attributes if you deem them important.

Product: A conventional product from any e-commerce site, the basic schema is
described below.
